<p><strong>Due date</strong>: Friday 2 February before 6:30pm.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The purpose of this lab is to give you some practice working with strings in C.</p>
<p>Complete each of the following programs in your lab4 repository folder according to the comments in each file. (Do a pull to download the starter code to your computer.)</p>
<p>The suggested order for writing these programs is:</p>
<ul>
<li>compare.c</li>
<li>truncate.c</li>
<li>strip.c</li>
<li>greeting.c</li>
</ul>
<p>We have provided a <code>Makefile</code> for your convenience. You do not need to change it. If you run the <code>make clean</code> command when you don't have all the executables built, it will report an error. That is not a problem.</p>
<h2 id="submission">Submission</h2>
<p>Remember to commit and push all changes to these files before the deadline. Do not commit any executables or any other files.</p>
